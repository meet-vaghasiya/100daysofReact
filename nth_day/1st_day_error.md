1.  i am not getting autocomplete extension in react in js file. so i found that, there is option also in which we can set only for currnt project.
    i.e. i add react mode on in js, so i get react auto suggestion in vs code. and also on autoformat.
2.  {} we can only use primitive data type in that. not object. i tried with date object.
