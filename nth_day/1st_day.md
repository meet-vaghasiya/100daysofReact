1.  q. what is react and why we use react ? => reusable component code and code sepration main goal
2.  differe between vue and react ?

        1. vue use class , react use className
        2. vue use template, script and style blog, where react use separe js and css file
        3.  compoent is in .vue file and in react it's jsx (where we can write javascript and html code ) file
        4. createStore instance taken from librrary. and use app.mount() for mouting whereas in react ReactDom.render() function is use
        5. defualt id in vue is app , where as in react is root.
        6. in vue we just add id name in mount function , where as in react we take node using document.getElementById('#root)
        7. vue3 give good project structure like pages and components directory but in vue js we have to make that.
        8. compoent in vue is file which contain template, script, style where as in react it is function which return html code.
        9. in react we have to use ExpenseItem component. where as vue js gives flexibility to use <expense-item></expense-item> or <ExpenseItem />
        10. in vue js , to render data in template, we use  double curly breaces , but in react we use single curly braces.
        11. in vue js there is main.js file, in react index.js file

3.  to see converted App.js code -> go to inspect element ->source -> static folder and search App() function in that.
    this, how react tranfer code jsx to js in background for whole app.
